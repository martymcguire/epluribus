        <li>Join the project by requesting a file to print. You will be assigned a part automatically.</li>
        <li>Download the STL file for your part from the project page.</li>
        <li>Print your given part within 24 hours. Check the project and part requirements for details like color, material, print settings, etc.</li>
        <li>Once it's printed, write your part ID on a non-visible face using a permanent marker. Feel free to add your initials or leave a note for the assembly team!</li>
        <li>Verify your printed part by uploading a photo of the part along with its length, width, and height measurements.</li>
        <li>Ship your part using the details in the project description.</li>
        <li>Let the assembly team know that your part has shipped. Be sure to include a tracking number if you have one!
          <ul>
            <li><em>Note: Once your part is verified, you can grab another. Combine shipments to save money!</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When all parts for a project have been received, the assembly team will put them all together to make a finished sculpture. Your name will appear on the project page as a valued contributor to the project!</li>
